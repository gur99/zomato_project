#  Zomato Data Science Project  

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling restaurant data from Zomato to extract business insights, understand customer behavior, and optimize restaurant performance. The work is carried out in **Jupyter Notebook** using **Python**, applying data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.  

Each line of code in this project is accompanied by a clear, professional explanation that translates its technical purpose into readable notes — serving as an in-notebook study guide and reference for future projects.

##  Objectives  
- Perform **data preprocessing** and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data formats.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key patterns in restaurant ratings, costs, and cuisines.  
- Apply **feature selection** and **feature transformation** techniques for model preparation.  
- Implement **machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict restaurant ratings and understand the key drivers of success.  
- Develop a **notebook with rich code commentary**, turning it into an interactive learning and documentation tool.

## Features  
- Step-by-step Jupyter Notebook workflow with explanatory comments.  
- Cleaned and well-structured dataset derived from raw Zomato restaurant data.  
- Visualizations for understanding distributions, trends, and relationships.  
- Hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV` for model optimization.  
- Clear documentation for every transformation, preprocessing, and model step.

##  How to Use  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Zomato-Data-Science.git
   cd Zomato-Data-Science

2.Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

4. Open the notebook (zomato_analysis.ipynb) and follow along — each cell is explained for better understanding.


## Learning Focus

This project is not just about building a model — it’s designed to document and explain every step in a way that strengthens understanding of:

Data cleaning and transformation

Feature selection and handling target leakage

Model evaluation and tuning

Writing clean, documented, and interpretable notebooks for Data Science
